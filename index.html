    <h3>How to identify and confirm the quality of fish</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A shiny skin with slime on the surface is a good sign that the fish is fresh and good quality.</li>
        <li>The fins should be clearly  defined and perky, not scraggy or broken.</li>
        <li>A moist, shiny and pink or red gill is a great sign that the fish is fresh and good quality. Stay away from fish that has brown or faded gills.</li>
        <li>Remember fresh fish should smell of the sea not fish. Also make sure that the fish smells appetising and not of a smelly odour that you hope will  disappear when you cook it.</li>
        
    </ul>
